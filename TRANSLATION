<Shinji is back from speaking with Rei Q, thinking she was Rei, trying to make nice talk and realizing that she isn't the Rei he saved. He then has a moment of people screaming in his head on what to do. "Pilot the EVA" "Don't do anything" "You have nothing to do here." "I don't know. -Rei" ect.>
＜Shinji, outside, hears someone playing the piano>
Kaworu: -From below-
        Come down here, Ikari-kun, let's talk!
<A few seconds pass>
Shinji:
        U-Uh, Aren't we going to talk?
Kaworu:
        I wanted to talk about a four-handed performance on the piano.
        Why don't we try it?
Shinji:
        Ah, it's fine. I can't do that.
Kaworu:
        It's important to change and start todo new things in order to live.
<Starts playing, presumably Kaworu holding his wrist to show him the notes>
Kaworu: See, it's easy.
        You just have to tap the keyboard　here.
<Kaworu shows him the notes>
        Now, why don't we try it?
<Shinji follows along>
        It's nice. Your notes are great.
        You're playing so well. We're amazing together, aren't we?
<End piano>
Shinji:
        Thanks, it feels like it's been a while since I've had so much fun.
Kaworu:
        Me too. Let's meet again sometime. You can come whenever, Ikari Shinji-kun.
Shinji:
        Yeah. Oh- Who are you?
Kaworu:
        I'm Kaworu, Nagisa Kaworu. I'm the same as you, a child chosen by fate.
<Time passes, next morning presumably>
Shinji:
        Do I have no luck either? [And educated guess, I'm assuming he's looking at something.]
Kaworu:
        Good morning, Ikari Shinji-kun. You're here early today.
Shinji:
         I don't really have anything else to do, so...
<Piano time>
        I wonder how I could do better...
Kaworu:
        You don't need to do anything. You can just go with whatever sounds good to you.
Shinji:
        Then, I want to make it sound better, how do I do that?
Kaworu:
        Memorization and practice.　Doing it over and over until it feels good enough to you. That's it.
<Piano over, goes silent>
<Shinji pulls out his broken SDAT>
Kaworu:
        It's okay, leave it to me. I can make it work.
Shinji:
        Yeah, thank you. I kind of feel bad for making you do so much for me.
Kaworu:
        You don't need to worry about that. We're friends.
Shinji:
        Ah...
Kaworu:
        It's gotten quite dark, hasn't it?
        Why don't we head back for today?
Shinji:
        Hey, why don't we stay here for a little longer?
        Let's watch the stars like this.
Kaworu:
        The stars?
        ...
        Do you like the stars?
Shinji:
        Yeah, when I feel how large the universe is, I feel small　in a kind of relaxing way,
        and it hasn't changed in 14 years either...It calms me down I guess...
        Ah, it's kind of hard to say it right.
Kaworu:
        You got your feelings through.
        Not looking for change, but rather a stable kind of world. It's like you.
        It's nice, I didn't know that lying out here together could be so pleasant. Thanks for inviting me.
Shinji:
        Oh, no you don't need to...I just was thinking that if you wanted to, it'd be fun and-
<Shinji turns his head, to find Kaworu looking right at him, an ode to episode 24>
Kaworu:
        It is fun.
        I really was born to meet you.
<End stargazing scene, cuts to next morning, Shinji brushing his teeth.>

~47:40min

<Looking at something in the mirror most likely. Sadly I have not seen the film but I'm assuming that Shinji is looking at his collar in the mirror with the first line.>
Shinji:
        Hm? I wonder if it's noticeable still...
        Huh?
<gasp>
Kaworu:
        Here, it should work now.
Shinji: Thanks, you're amazing, Nagisa-kun. You can do everything.
Kaworu:
        It was just following some instructions. It was just suspended in time a little longer than you.
Shinji:
        But still...You're amazing.
Kaworu:
        You don't look too well.
        What's wrong?
Shinji:
        I'm worried about my friends.
Kaworu:
        Friends?
Shinji:
        Yeah. I messed up on my mission [Having issues with the term he uses here]
        Everyone was there, Touji, Kensuke, Prez, everyone in my class. I was even asleep in Unit 01 for 14
        years, I don't know what's changed in that time...
Kaworu：
        It must be painful, not being able to endure the answer to that.
Shinji:
        Somehow, I'm scared.
        Of what's happened to everyone, I'm scared of it for some reason.
        That's right, I'm scared!
<Pause>
Kaworu:
        Do you want to know?
<Cut to Kaworu's infodump of what's happened>
